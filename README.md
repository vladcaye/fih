## Good day, I'm Vlad Caye.
> This project was brought to me by the FreshIceHockey community, who were looking for an official home online.
> 
> I managed to gather quite a bit of information in my first meeting but it was not enough to start building.
> 
> I created a Design Brief to make sure to tackle all the goals and aspirations that needed to get fufilled. I made sure to go through all of the short and long term goals in order to break them down in terms of priority. Last but not least, we determined what is my explicite responsibility in this project.
> 
> Once the Design Brief was agreed upon by both parties, I started created the minimum viable product to present as a prototype. It was a-go right away, great! Not to mention that I was quite satisfied with the basic layout, plus how simple and fast it rendered in the browser.
> 
> Now that the big part was out of the way, all that was left to do is to fill in the content on the different web pages and tweek the design a bit here and there to present it well.
> 
> In conclusion, I'm fairely happy with how the whole project turned out. And FreshIceHockey is very satisfied with their newly created website that will help them spread more love to their community.
> 
> If you have any questions, suggestions or suggestion.
